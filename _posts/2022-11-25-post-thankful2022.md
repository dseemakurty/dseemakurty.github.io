### #1: Monarch Money

Personal finance always devolves into static spreadsheets. No longer! 

@monarch_money
 makes it easy to manage cashflow, % invested in market, and allocating towards goals. Simple & great UX.

### #2: Klipsch The Fives Speakers

Good sound is always worth the money. 
@KlipschAudio
  nails the modern bookshelf system with the tech of a sound bar (HDMI, eARC, custom EQ), but the power and freq response of a top system w/ large drivers. 

Great system for entry audiophiles.

### #3: Fage 5% Greek Yogurt

This greek yogurt slaps. Sometimes, you just find the one. Rich, creamy, and not dry. Great source of protein.

Absolutely delicious with some blueberries and honey. 5 stars for the 5%.

### #4: Athlytic Fitness

The future of wearables will be heart-rate-variability and recovery scores. 

Exertion, rest, and recovery insights add clarity to your training beyond just heart rate. 
@athlytic_app
 unlocks this data from your existing Apple Watch.

### #5: Withings Steel HR

Most people need a fitness tracker and not a smartwatch (notifications on wrist).

A @Withings Steel HR has fitness prowess, syncs w/ Apple Health, ~30 day battery life, easy to dress up. Great alt for apple watch for parents.

### #6: One Sec 

Yea, its true, I struggle with using my phone too much. 

@frederikRiedel's app has been the best cure to bring intention to my digital app use. Definitely worth a try to stop the endless scrolling and build more sustainable habits.

### #7: Flutter

As a PM, learning new dev stacks is exhaustive. I love flutter to jam out product ideas and not worry about being locked to iOS or Android. 

@FlutterDev
 even now supports Web which made building http://superhire.xyz a blast.

Focus on products, not tech.

### #8: Wireless Carplay Adapter

Does your phone plug into your car for carplay/android auto? Well, for <$75 you can make that experience fully wireless with this little dongle!

Who needs a car upgrade when you can get a tech upgrade?

### #9: Google Nest Hub

Leave your phone outta your bedroom and improve your sleep w/ one of these. 

Serves as: alarm clock, tells you the weather, plays sleep music (and auto-stops when asleep), controls your home, and cycles your photos. 

For $50, it's incredible bang for buck.

### #10: Monkey 47 Gin

Last but not least, the holidays need a good gin. 
@MONKEY_47's description says it all: "german-distilled from 47 unusual but regional botanicals such as lingonberries". 

Keep a bottle hidden, this one moves fast at parties.
