It's surprising how many products I am just "meh" about, so sharing the ones that brightened my year is oddly satisfying. It is also fun to review my previous recommendations and see how many survived the test of time.

Here is a list of 10 products that impacted my 2023:

### 1. LL Bean Men's Mountain Classic Puffer Jacket

I still remember when my cofounder took me to an LL Bean store. I was nervous about my move to the winter'y winds of Chicago after years in So-cal, Texas, and India. There's something about the ethos of LL Bean's products that just resonates with me. While their duck shoes (their most famous product) are aesthetically hilarious, you know they mean business. This puffer jacket is no exception – perfect for any weather, it's my go-to for staying warm and packs super tight. Can't wait to upgrade to a down puffer next.

### 2. Stitch Fix
I've never been a fan of shopping for clothes. Something about the endless options urges me to retreat into a Steve Jobs-esque single outfit routine. But Stitch Fix changed the game for me. It's not just about looking better; it's also about the convenience of having items that fit without decision fatigue. Refreshing my wardrobe had never been easier, and I'm all for it.

### 3. Fidelity
Eighteen months working in Fintech opens your eyes to the complexity and archaic-ness of most financial products. I mean, banks are so undifferentiated for such a vital need. As I revamped my personal finances this year, Fidelity has become my go-to as an all-in-one financial solution. It simplified my banking, put my finances on autopilot, and helped me eliminate unnecessary accounts. They have been around for a long-time and aren't spending all their money on chasing growth. Fintechs are the future of finance, and Fidelity is doing a great job playing that game.

### 4. Garmin
Over a decade ago, I got my first GPS smartwatch - the Forerunner 305. It was as iconic as a Nokia those days. Since then, like most, I had jumped onto the Apple Watch train, with all the usual aspirations about the power of a computer on my wrist. And like most, I quickly turned off all notifications and just used it to track my daily activity, my sleep, and my exercise. Like most, I gas-lighted myself into thinking another item to charge daily is reasonable.

Battery life is the game-changer with Garmin. I really didn't anticipate how much I'd enjoy NOT having to think about battery life all the time. Now, I go 10 days before I have to think about charging. That's 3 charges a month instead of 30. I've given Venu's and Lily's as gifts, and rock a Vivoactive 5 myself. Although there are cheaper offerings by fly-by-night companies, Garmin is a brand that has survived the test of time.

### 5. MacBook Air (M-Series)
Obvious? Maybe. But if you're clinging to an older computer, it's time to let go. The M-series MacBook Air is a powerhouse – a piece of technology that's set to last a decade. Even now, I can confidently recommend a 2020 M1 MacBook Air, these chips are really that good. It's the first time you never have to think about the computer, and can just focus on whatever you need to do.

And yes, choose the M2 Air if you can.

### 6. MealLime
Meal planning can be daunting, especially in the era of Doordash. MealLime is probably what you have been looking for. Pick out a few recipes for the week, and it automatically generates you a grocery list, makes multiple portions for leftovers, and provides instructions step-by-step as you cook. I am probably not any better of a cook, but I definitely eat more variety and eat healthier because of it.

### 7. GitHub Codespaces & Copilot
Every year, I push myself to code a project or two to dust off the old cobwebs. This year, using Codespaces and Copilot really have made entering my "coding sprints" effortless and revealed the power that AI can have on side-hustle developers. Codespaces ensured my macbook didn't end up with 15 installs of python, and Copilot was a pair-programmer with infinite patience. I am really excited to see how far AI will help PMs and other non-professional programmers ship software.

### 8. Blumat Classic Plant Watering Stakes

Plants should be a joy, not a chore. The watering system I discovered this year made that possible. It uses old bottles (mine were from cold-brew) to keep plants watered perfectly, ideal for someone like me who travels a lot. I've had mine last 10 days without a hitch. Forget those info-mercial glass orbs; this is the real deal.

### 9. HomeKit Smart Plugs
These Homekit smart plugs are the ultimate stocking stuffer. Simple and secure. They connect right to Apple Homekit and don't require another 3rd party app. Smarten up the stuff you already have and love.

### 10. SpringDrive Technology
This is the one gold nugget from my quintessential deep-dive into wrist watches. The SpringDrive is a technology leap in watches - the only movement that converts human motion into a perfectly smooth expression of time. The technology behind still fascinates me – a spring coiled with energy, controlled by an electromagnetic brake and a precise IC.[Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HoEorK6elZM)

I can't yet validate buying an [SLGA007](https://grandseikoboutique.us/products/watch-spring-drive-5-day-lake-limited-slga007), but one day, I will fly to Japan and pick one up from the factory floor.
