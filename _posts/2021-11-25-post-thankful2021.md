I enjoy finding new solutions to pain-points I feel in my life. Today, I want to share my thanks to some of the products that have made 2021 a solid year for me.

### #1: The All-In Podcast

2021 was the year of podcasts for me. 

Of them all, the All-in-Podcast is best balance of fun, learning, critical thinking, and political commentary. Whether you are red-pilled or blue-pilled, this pod offers great value for anyone in tech.

Watching four absolute rockstars just banter about the world for an hour is *so* *whelming*.

### #2: CoPilot Personal Training Service

For years, I struggled with building a consistent gym routine. For me, the hard part isn't starting... its re-starting when I inevitably fall off the schedule. 

Copilot provides you with a remote personal trainer and a great software suite that keeps the experience fun, personalized, and methodical. Better yet, their wearable app automatically tracks my sets. Simple and seamless.

Do you need a personal trainer? No. Did I? Yes.

Let the numbers speak for themselves.

### #3: Ultra-wide Screen Monitor

If you work remotely, I highly recommend this upgrade to your monitor game. 34" inches of beautiful ultra-wide screen allows me to review three documents at once. The curve really makes the screen's edges feel more accessible.

The best part: this model has a built-in USB-C hub. With my speakers, mic, webcam, and power all plugged into the monitor, there is only one cable to connect my laptop for everything. 

What a brilliant experience.

### #4: Matter Reading App

I have been looking for this app for so long. A beautifully simple reading app with just the right balance of discovery, social sharing, and integrated highlighting.

Every article I read contributes to my knowledge rather than disappearing in seconds. If you want to read more this year, follow me, and share your favorite articles!

### #5: Orgain Simple Protein

I know that whey protein is the staple, but it always tasted and felt mediocre to me. Personally, I've been feeling much cleaner since I made the switch to plant protein. This powder is the first protein that I enjoy drinking everyday. 

Simple healthy ingredients. A decent price at Costco.

### #6: AirPods Pro

The original AirPods are one of my favorite all-time products. I have convinced at least 5 friends with my raving reviews. AirPods perfected simplicity.

The Pro's are something else though. They're a taste of next-gen audio processing available for everyone. 

Features like noise cancelation, transparency mode, spatial audio, head-tracking, and message announcements make something so small... feel so powerful.

### #7: Organic Deodorant

Thankful to a deodorant? Yea, I guess that's what makes a hippie. 

Whoever convinced us to shove random chemicals into our pits was a marketing genius. This stuff is organic, smells great, works just like any other deodorant, and gets you off the vicious cycle of aluminum & anti-perspirant. 

Best part, it's super easy to travel with.

### #8: Bedside Wireless Charging Dock

Bedside stands are just worth the money. Feels a bit posh to have a little home for your electronics, but not having to fiddle with cables every single night is just worth it. 

This one charges my phone, AirPods, and watch, all wirelessly and is super affordable.

*Note: I recommend using your official Apple Watch charger in this device instead of the included one*

### #9: Save Document / Sketch from Desktop

If you are about to get called in for family tech-support over the holidays, here is a macOS tip that will score some brownie points.

Just go to your desktop → right click → "import from XXX"

Magically your iPhone or iPad turns into a document scanner or signature pad. Seamless product integration. Bravo Apple.

### #10: Dot's Homestyle Pretzels

I never liked pretzels before. Now I do. 

Never thought of North Dakota before. Now I have.

Their seasoning has achieved an incredible umami per pretzel ratio. Many thanks to the stranger I met during paddle-boarding who made my day.

Note: These are NOT healthy. Yum.
